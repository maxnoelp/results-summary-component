## Hello and Welcome,

On my Coding Project from Frontend Mentor.

My Name is Max and i learning sine 2 weeks coding in Html, CSS and JavaScript.

I used a Grid Layout and in the Grid, i used Flexbox elements. Its for me easier to make a good layout. Then I looked at how the whole thing behaves and first test was good. So I started with the design and aligned everything as I needed it. Then everything got some colour.Of course I also changed something in the HTML, elements were closed with section and divs, got a class.It was very difficult for me to find out how to make the second number more transparent in the score. But I managed it with <small> and adopted it directly. I love to try out and test new things, I hope you like my project and wish you continued success.
